I am currently a Master student at University of Zurich major in Data Science and Minor in Information System. Before that I completed my BSc. study at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in Statistics (Data Science Stream). In the meantime, I also register myself as a special student in ETH Zurich for taking additional courses and student projects.

My previous research and study background are related with Medical Image Processing, 3D Vision, Natural Language Processing (Recommendation and Sentiment Analysis) and LLM Chatbot.

I'm currently looking for potential opportunities for Student Project/Research Assistant/Internship positions related with LLM/VLM study. Please contact through email if you are interested!
